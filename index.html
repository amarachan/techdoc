        <header>Introduction</header>
        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures
            and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic
            typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid
            application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for
            all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The
            same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and
            tools, and additional documentation.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other
            languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

        <header>Prequsites and Using the Python Interpreter</header>
        <p>A computer with any operating system like Linux (debian, redhat etc), windows, macos and python can
            downloaded and installed from <a href="https://www.python.org">www.python.org</a></p>
        <p><strong>Invoking the Interpreter</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.9 on those machines where it is
                available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by
                typing the command:python3
            </li>
            <li>to the shell. 1 Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option,
                other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g.,
                /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)</li>
            <li>On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.9 command will
                be available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command. See Excursus:
                Setting environment variables for other ways to launch Python.</li>
            <li>Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes
                the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by
                typing the following command: quit().</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="main-section">
        <header>Argument Passing</header>
        <p>When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of
            strings and assigned to the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list by executing import
            sys. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, sys.argv[0] is an
            empty string. When the script name is given as '-' (meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to '-'. When
            -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'. When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name
            of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by the Python
            interpreter’s option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
        <header>Interactive Mode</header>
        <p>When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts
            for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (<span> >>> </span>); for continuation lines
            it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message
            stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:</p>
        <code><span> $ </span> python3.9
            Python 3.9 (default, June 4 2019, 09:25:04)
            [GCC 4.8.2] on linux
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
            <br> 
            >>>
         </code>
        <p>As an example, take a look at this simple Hello World! program</p>
        <code>
            >>>print("Hello World!")
            <br>
            Hello World!
        </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
        <header>Numbers</header>
        <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value.
            Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages
            (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>
        <code>
            >>>2 + 2
            <br>
            4
            <br>
            >>>50 - 5*6
            <br>
            20
            <br>
            >>>(50 - 5*6) / 4
            <br>
            5.0
            <br>
            >>>8 / 5 # division always returns a floating point number
            <br>
            1.6

        </code>
        <p>The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type
            float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.

            Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any
            fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:
            <span> >>> </span>

        </p>
        <code>

            >>>17 / 3 # classic division returns a float
            <br>
            5.666666666666667
            <br>
            >>>17 // 3 # floor division discards the fractional part
            <br>
            5
            <br>
            >>>17 % 3 # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
            <br>
            2
            <br>
            >>>5 * 3 + 2 # result * divisor + remainder
            <br>
            17
        </code>
        <p>With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers</p>
        <code>
            >>>width = 20 <br>
>>>height = 5 * 9 <br>
>>>width * height <br>
900
        </code>
        <p>If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:</p>
        <code>
            >>> n  # try to access an undefined variable
            <br>
Traceback (most recent call last): <br>
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line 1, in <span>&lt;module&gt;</span> <br>
NameError: name 'n' is not defined <br>
        </code>

    <section class="main-section">
        <header>Strings</header>
        <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape quotes:</p>
        <code>
            >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes <br>
            'spam eggs' <br>
            >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote... <br>
            "doesn't" <br>
            >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
            "doesn't" <br>
            >>> '"Yes," they said.' <br>
            '"Yes," they said.'</code> <br>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
        <header>Lists</header>
<p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>
        <code>
            >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br>
>>> squares <br>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
        </code>
        <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:</p>
        <code>
            >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item <br>
1 <br>
>>> squares[-1] <br>
25 <br>
>>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list <br>
[9, 16, 25]
        </code>
<p>All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list:</p>
        <code>
            >>> squares[:] <br>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
        </code>
        <p>Lists also support operations like concatenation:</p>
        <code>
            >>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100] <br>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
        </code>
<p>Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:</p>
<code>
    >>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here <br>
    >>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65! <br>
    64 <br>
    >>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value <br>
    >>> cubes <br>
    [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
</code>
<p>You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the append() method (we will see more about methods later):</p>
<code>
    >>> cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6 <br>
>>> cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7 <br>
>>> cubes <br>
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]
</code>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
        <header>if Statements</header>
        <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
        <code>
            >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: ")) <br>
Please enter an integer: 42 <br>
>>> if x < 0: <br>
...     x = 0 <br>
...     print('Negative changed to zero') <br>
... elif x == 0: <br>
...     print('Zero') <br>
... elif x == 1: <br>
...     print('Single') <br>
... else: <br>
...     print('More') <br>
... <br>
so-on
        </code>
<p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.</p>
